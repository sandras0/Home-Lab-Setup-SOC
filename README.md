  Home SOC Lab - Step-by-Step Setup Guide

  Step 1: Prepare Your Virtual Environment   
  
        To create an isolated SOC lab, use VirtualBox or VMware to set up multiple virtual machines.

        üîπ Kali Linux (SIEM Server) ‚Äì Install Splunk for centralized log analysis.
        üîπ Windows 10/11 (Client System) ‚Äì Install Splunk Universal Forwarder to send logs to the SIEM.

   Step 2: Install Splunk on Kali Linux
                
        1Ô∏è‚É£ Download Splunk
        Run the following command in Kali Linux to download Splunk:

```bash
        wget -O splunk.deb https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.0.3/linux/splunk-9.0.3-amd64.deb
```
        2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Splunk
        Use dpkg to install it:
   
```bash
        sudo dpkg -i splunk.deb
```
        3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Splunk and Accept the License
        
```bash
        sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license
```
        4Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Splunk to Start on Boot
```bash
        sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start
```
        5Ô∏è‚É£ Access Splunk Web UI
        Open a browser and go to:
        
```bash
        http://localhost:8000
```
        Login with:
        Username: splunk_admin
        Password: (Set during setup) 
        
   Step 3: Install Splunk Universal Forwarder on Windows


   The Universal Forwarder sends logs from Windows to your Splunk SIEM.
        
        1Ô∏è‚É£ Download and Install Forwarder
        
        Download the Splunk Universal Forwarder from Splunk Downloads.
        Install it using default settings.
        Set up a user account for Splunk.

        2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect the Forwarder to the Splunk Server
        
        Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
        Run this command (replace <Kali-IP> with your actual Kali Linux IP):

```bash
        splunk add forward-server <Kali-IP>:9997 -auth admin:changeme
```
        Enable log forwarding:

```bash
        splunk enable boot-start
```
        Restart the forwarder:
```bash
        splunk restart
```

   Step 4: Configure Data Inputs in Splunk

    Login to Splunk Web UI on Kali Linux (http://localhost:8000).
    Go to Settings > Data Inputs.
    Add a new TCP/UDP input and set the port to 9997.
    Check if logs are received from the Windows Forwarder using:

```bash
    index=_internal | stats count by host
```

  Step 6: Test the Home SOC Lab
